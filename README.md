# Compile with:

nvcc -o main main.cu

# USE ONLY THE PUZZLES THAT START WITH 1

## I'll explain how the transformation works:

1) a base random number is generated
2) it is converted into a binary like "110011"
3) a shift to the left is made (a full circle)
4) at each shift of 1 bit, a vertical circle is made 16 times in hex from 0 to F
5) a binary is flipped
6) bits are inverted
7) all this is done in cycles nested within each other

all these operations occur in thousands of threads, the more powerful the GPU, the more parallel transformations

all keys within one full transformation are unique, there are no repetitions.... unless the base number itself is repeated (which is unlikely on large ranges)

proof that it works, you can check it on short puzzles, it works like a clock, on large ranges it will take more time of course, but this is a chance to try your luck in a different style

this algorithm is available both on python (CPU), and on GPU

I believe this is an effective way to search
